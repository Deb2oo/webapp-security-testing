\# 🔐 Web Application Security Testing Project



\## About This Project

I built this project to get hands-on experience in real-world web security testing. Instead of just learning theory, I practically tested a vulnerable web application using industry-standard tools to understand how attackers think and how applications can be protected.



\## What I Did

During this project, I manually and automatically tested a web application for common security flaws based on the OWASP Top 10. My main focus was finding and understanding how vulnerabilities actually work in real scenarios.



\## Tools I Used

\- Burp Suite (Community Edition)

\- OWASP ZAP



\## Vulnerabilities I Tested

\- SQL Injection (SQLi)

\- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

\- Authentication and Session Management Issues



\## Skills I Gained

\- Intercepting and analyzing live web traffic

\- Performing manual and automated security testing

\- Understanding how real-world web vulnerabilities work

\- Writing clear security reports with fixes and recommendations



\## Why This Project Matters

This project helped me move from theory to practice and gave me confidence in web security fundamentals. It’s a step toward building strong skills in ethical hacking and application security.
